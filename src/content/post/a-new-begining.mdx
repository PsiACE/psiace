## Hey, World!

I am pleased to announce that I have built a new blog with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/) and [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) theme.

I have deleted all previous content and started fresh.

## Why and Why Not?

I had been considering this idea for a few months, but my recent conversation with [@Xuanwo](https://github.com/xuanwo) prompted me to make the decision.

I can find many reasons to explain why, such as:

> I want to connect with more people and make a greater impact.

> I want to express my insights better rather than just keeping a record of events.

But in reality, there isn't much thinking involved, it's just a simple "Why not?"

I can make decisions for myself. Just doing my best is enough.
