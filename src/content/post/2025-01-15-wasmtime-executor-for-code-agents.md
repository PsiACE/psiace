In the development of AI agents, code execution has become a critical feature. However, allowing AI to execute code directly poses significant security risks. This article explores why sandbox environments are crucial for Code Agents and how WebAssembly provides a promising solution to this problem.

## Why Code Agents Need Sandboxed Environments?

One of the core capabilities of Code Agents is the ability to generate and execute code to solve problems. This capability allows AI to:

- Perform data analysis and visualization
- Execute complex computational tasks
- Interact with external APIs
- Process files and data

However, executing AI-generated code directly in the host environment poses significant security risks:

1. **System access risk**: AI may generate code that accesses sensitive files, network resources, or system calls
2. **Resource consumption**: Malicious or erroneous code may consume significant CPU, memory, or storage resources
3. **Privilege escalation**: Code may attempt to gain higher system privileges
4. **Data leakage**: Sensitive data may be accidentally accessed or transmitted

As shown in the [Hugging Face smolagents project](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/remote_executors.py), modern AI agent frameworks have begun to prioritize code execution security, offering multiple executor options to balance functionality and security.

## WebAssembly: A Promising Solution

WebAssembly (WASM) was originally designed to safely execute high-performance code in browsers, but its sandboxing features make it an ideal choice for server-side secure code execution.

### Security Advantages of WASM

1. **Memory safety**: WASM runs in a controlled memory environment, preventing buffer overflow attacks
2. **Capability restrictions**: By default, WASM modules cannot access the file system, network, or system calls
3. **Resource control**: Memory usage and execution time can be precisely controlled
4. **Isolation**: Each WASM instance runs in an isolated sandbox

### Community Discussion and Practice

This idea is not new. In the [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34581487), developers have already explored the possibility of using WASM for secure code execution.

Simon Willison's [TIL article](https://til.simonwillison.net/webassembly/python-in-a-wasm-sandbox) provides a concrete implementation example, demonstrating how to run Python code in a WebAssembly sandbox using wasmtime-py and VMware's Python WASM.

## My Implementation: Wasmtime Executor

Based on these discussions and practices, I developed a simple WASM executor that can serve as a replacement for smolagents' PythonExecutor. You can find the implementation in [Wasmtime Executor Demo](https://github.com/psiace/psiace/tree/main/demo/wasmtime-executor).

### Usage Example

```python
from wasmtime_executor import WasmtimePythonExecutor
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

class WasmtimeCodeAgent(CodeAgent):
    def create_python_executor(self):
        return WasmtimePythonExecutor(
            additional_authorized_imports=self.additional_authorized_imports,
            max_print_outputs_length=self.max_print_outputs_length,
            **self.executor_kwargs,
        )

# Usage is the same as the standard CodeAgent
agent = WasmtimeCodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=InferenceClientModel(),
    additional_authorized_imports=["math", "json"],
)

result = agent.run("Calculate the square root of 125")
```

## Conclusion

Sandboxed environments are crucial for Code Agent security. WebAssembly provides a solution that balances security and functionality, although there are still some limitations, its potential is not to be ignored.

My Wasmtime Executor implementation demonstrates how to integrate WASM technology into existing AI agent frameworks, providing a practical solution for secure code execution. As the WebAssembly ecosystem continues to develop, I believe this approach will play an increasingly important role in secure code execution for AI agents.
