## Quick Snapshot

- **GenAI Platform — Technical Owner @ Vesoft (NebulaGraph)**  
  Built graph-native pipelines and **GraphRAG** patterns for production LLM workloads.
- **Apache OpenDAL™ — PMC member**  
  Driving a unified storage layer so multiple backends (S3/GCS/HDFS/local) feel native.
- **Databend (2021–2024) — Founding Engineer & KOL/DevRel**  
  Worked across query execution & storage I/O in a Rust cloud data engine; closed the loop with docs, tutorials, and community programs.

## What I Care About

- **Enduring platforms** → predictable performance, clean contracts, strong observability.  
- **Graph intelligence** → retrieval that respects structure, not just tokens.  
- **Inclusive OSS** → documentation, examples, and review culture that scales contributors.

## Selected Speaking & Writing

- **Talks**: PyCon China · KCD Beijing · Rust China Conf · CommunityOverCode  
- **Recent**: "Agent Has No Secret" (patterns for agents) · "Self-Bootstrapping Coding Agent in Python"
