## Hi, I'm PsiACE 👋

**AI needs structure. I build it.**

I work on the **structure layer beneath AI systems**:
data, context, capability, memory, and ecosystem,
so intelligence becomes **reliable, observable, and reusable**.

---

### What I work on

- Data systems & execution/storage foundations
- Unified abstraction layer
- Structured context for AI
- Capability protocols & SDKs
- Open-source governance & ecosystem structure

---

### Current focus

- **Senior Engineer @ OceanBase** - open-source and ecosystem engineering for a production-grade database system  
- **PMC Member @ Apache OpenDAL**

---

### Selected projects
 
- **[ACP Python SDK](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/python-sdk)** - Capability-layer SDK for AI agents and tools

---

> Structure first. Then intelligence.
