Hi, I'm **Chojan**—a platform engineer focused on getting AI systems production-ready. I lead GenAI platform work at Vesoft/NebulaGraph, serve on the Apache OpenDAL PMC, and previously helped build Databend from the storage layer up.

I care a lot about predictable infrastructure, graph-native retrieval, and documentation that scales teams. Around here you'll find deep dives on agent protocols, graph-powered RAG, and experiments in resilient data systems.
