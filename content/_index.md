Hi, I'm **Chojan** (PsiACE).
I lead GenAI platform work at Vesoft/NebulaGraph, serve on the Apache OpenDAL PMC, and previously helped build Databend from query execution to storage I/O.

I care about predictable infrastructure, graph-native retrieval, and docs that scale contributors.
Expect field notes on agent workflows, Fusion GraphRAG, and resilient data systems.
