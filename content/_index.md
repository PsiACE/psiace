Hi, I'm **Chojan** (PsiACE).
GenAI engineer at Vesoft (NebulaGraph), leading the NebulaGraph GenAI Platform and driving GraphRAG and agent workflows to production and standardization.
PMC member at Apache OpenDAL, improving the unified storage interface for usability and stability.
Previously a founding/core engineer at Databend, contributing to multiple core refactors and community documentation/tutorials.

I care about predictable infrastructure and open collaboration that scales contributors.
