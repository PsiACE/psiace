## Hey, World!

I am delighted to announce the launch of my new blog, which is powered by [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/) and features the [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) theme.

In this fresh start, I have cleared all previous content to create a clean slate.

## Why and Why Not?

The idea of starting anew had been on my mind for a few months, but it was my recent conversation with [@Xuanwo](https://github.com/xuanwo) that finally pushed me to take action.

There are numerous reasons behind this decision:

> I aspire to connect with a broader audience and have a more significant impact.

> I aim to express my insights more effectively, moving beyond mere documentation of events.

However, in reality, the decision was not driven by extensive contemplation; it was simply a matter of “Why not?”

Striving to do my best is sufficient.

I hope you’ll join me on this exciting journey!
