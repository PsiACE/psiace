When I first started working on the **[Agent Client Protocol Python SDK](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/python-sdk)**, it was a small side project born out of curiosity.
I wanted to understand how coding agents communicate—how state, intent, and messages flow between the client and the agent.

Over time it grew into something real.
More developers began to use it—from **Moonshot** to other model companies exploring agent workflows.
The SDK became more stable, closely tracking the evolving ACP spec and serving as a foundation for real-world integrations.

Today marks a new chapter.
The Python SDK has officially moved under the **[agentclientprotocol](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol)** organization, joining the TypeScript, Rust, and Kotlin SDKs as part of the official ecosystem.

I will keep maintaining and improving it there.
My focus stays on reliability, clarity, and making it easier for developers to build agentic systems.

Special thanks to **Sergey Ignatov**, **Anna**, and **Ben** for their trust and support during this transition—and to everyone who has used, contributed to, or shared feedback on this SDK.

This project started as an experiment, but it has become a shared effort.
Here is to the next chapter—together.
