Hi, I'm **Chojan Shang** (aka **PsiACE**).
I focus on engineering data and AI systems that are predictable, observable, and maintainable — not one-off demos.

## Experience & Responsibilities

**GenAI Engineer | Vesoft Inc. (NebulaGraph)**  
2024.09 – present · Shanghai  
- Deliver GraphRAG and Generative AI for graph-database scenarios across retrieval, Q&A, and recommendation.
- Lead the architecture and engineering of the NebulaGraph GenAI Platform: ingest → retrieval (vector/graph) → inference; establish unified observability (latency, recall, hit rate).
- Design and implement a Fusion GraphRAG framework that fuses structural graph knowledge with semantic retrieval; achieved ~30% faster time-to-first-use and ~15% precision uplift at the same compute.
- Drive LLM engineering integration with the Nebula ecosystem (schema, data sync, auth/audit); codify reusable components and best practices to power QA and recommendation systems.

**PMC Member | Apache OpenDAL**  
2022 – present · Remote  
- Lead and contribute to the unified data access layer's architecture and releases; focus on caching, retries, observability, and multi-cloud backend abstraction.
- Review critical PRs and design proposals; improve API consistency and platform stability; optimize data paths and metrics for high-concurrency / high-latency scenarios.
- Build community norms and engineering standards; strengthen docs and test examples; mentor contributors and manage OSPP cadence; helped the project graduate to Apache TLP.

**Core Engineer | Databend Labs (cloud-native data warehouse)**  
2021.07 – 2024.08 · Remote  
- Founding team member; built baseline query execution and storage access layers; unified I/O model around Apache Arrow/Parquet.
- Led integrations with lakeFS and KubeSphere; delivered a unified access layer and caching for cloud-native data-lake scenarios.
- Optimized execution and storage I/O to support high-throughput concurrent workloads; project stars grew from ~800 to 8000+ in three years.
- Drove developer advocacy and community programs that turned Databend into a representative OSS data warehouse.

## Focus Areas

- Predictable, observable, and maintainable platform engineering.
- Graph-driven retrieval and reasoning that respect structure, not just tokens.
- Documentation- and example-driven OSS that scales contributions.

## Speaking & Writing (selected)

- Talks: PyCon China, KCD Beijing, Rust China Conf, CommunityOverCode.
- Recent: agent protocols and workflows, engineering Graph-augmented RAG at production quality.

## Education

- M.S. Applied Mathematics & Data Science (2022–2024)  
- B.S. Computer Science & Technology (2017–2021)
