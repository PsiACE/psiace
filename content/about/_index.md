Hi, I'm **Chojan Shang** (online as **PsiACE**). I build resilient data and AI platforms with a focus on predictable performance, strong observability, and contracts that scale teams—not just demos.

## What I'm Doing

- **GenAI Platform — Technical Owner @ Vesoft (NebulaGraph)**  
  Designing graph-native pipelines and GraphRAG patterns that keep production LLM workloads explainable and debuggable.
- **Apache OpenDAL — PMC member**  
  Driving a unified storage layer so S3, GCS, HDFS, and local backends feel native across runtimes.
- **Databend (2021–2024) — Founding Engineer & DevRel**  
  Worked across query execution and storage I/O in a Rust cloud data engine while running docs, tutorials, and community programs.

## What I Care About

- **Enduring platforms** with clean contracts, high observability, and repeatable performance.
- **Graph intelligence** where retrieval respects structure, not just tokens.
- **Inclusive OSS** that wins with docs, examples, and review culture.

## Stage Time & Writing

- **Talks:** PyCon China, KCD Beijing, Rust China Conf, CommunityOverCode.
- **Recent essays:** “Agent Has No Secret,” “Self-Bootstrapping Coding Agent in Python,” and ongoing field notes on agent protocols and graph-backed RAG.

## Credentials

- **M.S. Applied Mathematics & Data Science** (2022–2024)  
- **B.S. Computer Science & Technology** (2017–2021)
