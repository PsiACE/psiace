Hi, I'm PsiACE, an open-source engineer.

My work focuses on the **structure layer beneath AI systems**:
the structure of data, context, capability, and the ecosystems that make collaboration possible.

I started from cloud-native databases and data systems,
building execution and storage foundations at Databend.
I later worked on unified data access abstractions and open-source governance at Apache OpenDAL.
More recently, I've been building structured context and reasoning pipelines for AI systems,
including context construction and capability-layer tooling.

What I care about is not how intelligent a model looks,
but whether intelligence can be **trusted, explained, and sustained** in real systems.

**AI needs structure. I build it.**
