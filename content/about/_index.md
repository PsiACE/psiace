Hi, I'm **Chojan Shang** (aka **PsiACE**).
I focus on engineering data and AI systems with clear contracts, observable operations, and auditable workflows.
Not one‑off demos, but maintainable and measurable product capabilities.

## Experience & Responsibilities

**GenAI Engineer | Vesoft Inc. (NebulaGraph)**  
2024.09 – present · Shanghai  
- Deliver GraphRAG and generative AI in graph‑database scenarios across retrieval, Q&A, and recommendation.
- Lead the architecture and engineering of the NebulaGraph GenAI Platform: ingest → retrieval (vector/graph) → inference.
- Design and implement a Fusion GraphRAG framework that fuses structural graph knowledge with semantic retrieval to optimize context building for complex relational QA.
- Advance LLM engineering workflows and codify reusable components and best practices.

**PMC Member | Apache OpenDAL**  
2022 – present · Remote  
- Contribute to and help lead the unified data access layer’s architecture and releases, focusing on caching, retries, observability, and multi‑cloud backend abstraction.
- Review critical PRs and design topics, driving API consistency and platform stability; optimize data paths for high‑concurrency and high‑latency scenarios.
- Build community norms and engineering standards, improve docs and examples, mentor contributors, and coordinate OSPP participation to improve contributor retention and release cadence.

**Core Engineer | Databend Labs (cloud‑native data warehouse)**  
2021.07 – 2024.08 · Remote  
- Founding team member; built baseline query execution and storage access layers; unified I/O around Apache Arrow/Parquet.
- Led integrations and case studies with HuggingFace, lakeFS, and KubeSphere to broaden data‑lake/cloud‑native scenarios.
- Drove developer advocacy and community operations; the project grew from ~800 to 8000+ stars in three years and became a representative OSS data warehouse.

## Focus Areas

- Predictable, observable, and maintainable platform engineering.
- Graph-driven retrieval and reasoning that respect structure, not just tokens.
- Documentation- and example-driven OSS that scales contributions.

## Speaking & Writing (selected)

- Talks: PyCon China, KCD Beijing, Rust China Conf, CommunityOverCode.
- Recent: agent protocols and workflows, engineering Graph-augmented RAG at production quality.

## Education

- M.S. Applied Mathematics & Data Science (2022–2024)  
- B.S. Computer Science & Technology (2017–2021)
